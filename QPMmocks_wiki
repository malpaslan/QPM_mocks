= Quick Particle-Mesh (QPM) mocks =

These are alternative mock catalogs to the PThalo approach. They are based on low-resolution particle mesh simulations. 

This page focuses on documenting the simulations and respective halo catalogs.

These mock catalogs have a few advantages over PThalos: 
 * better small scale clustering (halos are about the right size)
 * likely better velocity fields
 * continuous halo mass below simulation resolution (peak background split)
 * generated from publicly available code ([wiki:BOSS/mockFactory]) which you can tweak and rerun!

== Latest Mocks ==

Currently only CMASS QPM mocks exist. A static HOD was applied to the QPM halo catalogs (see description on [wiki:BOSS/clustering/QPMmocks]) at a static snapshot redshift of z=0.55.  The HOD was chosen such that clustering amplitude should correspond to observed CMASS galaxy measurements. 

=== Periodic BOX Mocks ===

These mocks in '''full simulation volume''' are available at NERSC: 
{{{
 /global/project/projectdirs/boss/galaxy/QPM/mocks/
}}}

These are in ascii format and include 9 columns: [[BR]]
`X Y Z Vx Vy Vz MASS_HALO FLAG_SAT ID_HALO`

These are created from the QPM halo catalogs using the `mockFactory/QPM_mocks` code. See [wiki:BOSS/mockFactory].

== Simulations and Halo Catalogs ==

There are two versions of the QPM catalogs, an older (deprecated) version and a newer version.  Both use the same setup for the N-body simulations and HOD processing, but a different method is adopted for generating mock halos in each case.

For each set of catalogs we ran 1000 low force- and mass-resolution particle-mesh N-body simulations.  These each used 1280^3^ particles in box of side length 2560 Mpc/h. The chosen cosmology has OmegaM=0.29, h=0.7, ns=0.97 and sigma8=0.8. Each simulation was started from 2LPT ICs at z=25 and evolved to the present using time steps of 15% in ln(a).  

For both catalogs we output data at z=0.7, 0.55, 0.4 and 0.25.  For the old catalogs we output a subsample of the N-body particles and a catalog of halos with more than 32 particles generated by the friends-of-friends algorithm with a linking length of 0.2 times the mean inter-particle spacing. The subsampled particles form a random sample except that halo particles are vetoed. For each particle, we save the position, velocity, and local density smoothed on 10 Mpc/h scales. We extend the halo catalog to lower masses by annointing a set of the subsampled particles as halos and assigning them a mass using the peak-background split mass function.  For the newer catalogs we did not generate FoF halos and we output a random subsample of the particles along with a density smoothed on 2Mpc/h scales.


== Available Data ==

The QPM "simulations" are archived at NERSC, and are generally available.  The halo catalogs (generated using the QPM method from downsampled particles and their densities) are also on disk.  Ask us if you need to find these.
